Performance issues; in the code:
1. The use of usleep() function with a very high delay value (9000000) can cause the program to pause for a long time, making it unresponsive.
2. The choice1() function is defined but not implemented, causing a compilation error.
3. The choice1() function takes multiple parameters, which can make the function call cumbersome and error-prone.
4. The code lacks error handling for fgets() input, potentially leading to buffer overflow issues.

Rewritten code to address the performance issues:
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
